**This project originally came from an assignment after a data science bootcamp program that I attended. Which is why you can see there are several folders of tasks that contain instructions about business questions that must be answered based on data and my presentation file for each of them.**

## Project Description

- The hospitality industry encompasses businesses that provide accommodation for guests, including room reservations, meals, and other facilities. It can range from small to large enterprises, from one-star to five-star hotels. Success in this industry depends on factors such as location, service quality, and competitive pricing. The demand for comfortable and affordable accommodation makes the hotel business a viable option for entrepreneurs. It's important to understand the target market and the health of the hotel business to devise appropriate strategies and provide services and facilities tailored to their needs.

- This project will analyze the hotel business by processing historical data to obtain information about hotel bookings, length of stay, and the time interval between booking and cancellation.

- The dataset for this project can be found in `hotel_bookings_data.csv` file, contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.

Here is the initial walkthrough of the task:

- `Task 1` explains the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and initial preprocessing stages, including handling missing & invalid values, addressing duplicated rows, transforming and filtering data, and conducting basic statistical analysis to prepare the dataset for further investigation.

- `Task 2` details the analysis comparing the number of hotel bookings each month based on hotel type (city hotel vs. resort hotel), helping to identify seasonal trends and booking patterns across different accommodation types.

- `Task 3` explores the correlation between customer stay duration and hotel booking cancellation rates, examining whether longer or shorter planned stays are more likely to result in cancellations.

- `Task 4` investigates whether the time interval between when a hotel booking is made and the customer's planned arrival date influences the cancellation rate of hotel reservations, providing insights into advance booking behaviors.

> For each task, the summary can be accessed in the presentation file and technical details can be accessed in the main `Investigate Hotel Business Using Data Visualization Code.ipynb` file.
